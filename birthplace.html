                Grace O'Malley was born around 1530 at Belcare Castle, Claire Island near Westport. She was the only daughter of Eoghan Dubhdara (Black Oak) O’Malley and Margaret or Maeve Ní Mháille. She is commonly known by her Irish nickname Granuaile or Gráinne ni Mhaille, a name reputed to come from the Irish for bald (Mhaol). According to legend Grannie, as a young girl, wanted to join her father on the sea and travel with him to Spain. Her mother disagreed saying she was a girl and not a sailor. Grainne shaved off her hair to disguise herself as a boy. Her father gave in and so Grainne got on board and became Grainne Mhaol.As a child she lived at her family’s castles of Belclare Castle and Clare Island. She was educated and it is said she spoke Latin.
                She was born to be galley captain, sea trader, sea raider, virago, diplomat and a great leader. She had a force of character that comes only once in a century.
                When her father died she inherited his large shipping and ‘trading business’ and became Queen of Umaill, chieftain of the Ó Máille clan.
