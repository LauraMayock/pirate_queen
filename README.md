## Site Stucture

The website has seven pages, with three accessible by the navigation bar at the top of the page. The Navigation bar consists of a Home tab(index.html), an Her Story tab(history.html) and a contact us tab(contact-us.html). The logo on the left-hand side of the navigation bar is also a link to the home page. The final four pages are accessible using the four links under the 4 images on the home page. These bring you to pages showing key events in Grace O'Malleys life. 

## Design Choices

I tried to keep the design simple and keep the users in mind, giving them as much value as possible within the remit given. The historical information is given in a clear and easy to read snippets. 

### Imagery

The hero image was found on ????????. I loved the colours and felt it was a strong image that perfectly encapsulates Grace O'Malleys character.
 
### Logo

The logo on the left-hand side of the screen is 

### Colour scheme

My final choice of colours was chosen to fit in with the logo. A selection of Teal Green, and white. As the green was an intense colour, I knew they were a great choice of colour for contrasting, ensuring the eligibility of text and sticking with the theme of simplicity.

### Typography

I chose two fonts from the google font gallery. Comfortaa for the main text and Patua One for the information in the footer and the font on the contactus form. I did try a few options to highlight the quote below the hero video but decided against it as it was too jarring. I chose Arial as the font family to fall back on for Comfortaa as it would still fit in with the feel of the page. And the font Georgia as a fallback for Patua One.

# Features

## Navigation

* The navigation menu is positioned at the top of each page and gives the user easy access to the main areas of the website.
* The logo, which is also prominent on each page, gives an easy link back to the main page.
* The navigational link to the Pre-booking form is purposely placed within the advertisements, which are solely related to the event organised by the mother and baby group.
* This is to ensure minimum confusion for the user of the site.
* To ensure eligibility and easy use, the navigation bar converts from a row of navigation buttons at the top of the page to a row nestled beneath the logo on smaller screens.

* Each navigation link has a hover element as a visual add for the user. 

## Home Page

* As it is the landing page, it needed to appeal to the eye and striking. I wanted it to be memorable and unique but in keeping with the tone of the page. As the users lifesytles are busy, it is vital that the user immediately know they are on the correct website at a glance.
* For the larger screens, the hero video is falling a bit below the screen; this intuitively nudges the user to scroll down. On the smaller screens, you can see the opening heading which, as well as the hero video, is purposely chosen to connect with the user.

Landing page small screen



* The main text area gives a quick overview of what to expect at each meeting. It provides critical information to alleviate user concerns by pointing out who the group facilitates and the amenities available to them and their child. 

* The Weekly meet up section gives a day, time and google link to the location of each of the meetups. Again the simple prominent design was purposely done for a user on the go. 

* The Testimonials section is also a key element in encouraging anxious new parents that the Westport mother and baby group is perfect for them. It helps lay the foundation of trust and kinship with the user by providing testimonials from users to relate to.

* Each element on this page has the first time user, the new parent eager to connect with their local community, and the returning user looking to find the information required quickly.



## Events Page

* The events pages provide up to date information on events organised by the Mother and baby ground and the community. This gives parents and carers a one-stop destination to find events, courses and family fun in their area. Ensuring return users to the website and a continued connection with families that have moved on from baby/toddler-aged children. 

* There are visuals for the user via photos of the events and a video with controls to give the user full control of its workings.

* The events section also links a pre-booking from within the website (pre-booking-form.html). The user can pre-book their chosen event, and the organisers can gauge popularity in the event and plan accordingly.

* I have purposely chosen to leave the link to the prebooking form blue and underlined; this is for easy recognition.

# Future Features

* It would be very beneficial to upgrade the pre-booking page to a booking page. This would be beneficial for bothering the user and the customer.

* A resources section with access to local resources such as a list of local doctors, healthcare professions, and local amenities. This would be a great added benefit for first-time users and ensure returning users.

* A blog section would help keep users up to date with local news and keep users engaged.

* An online form would be such a benefit for users to connect with others in the area.

## Bugs Fixed

### HTML Validation
    
The following error was presented once the website was placed through W3C HTML Validator.

<a href="https://ibb.co/JRNF7YZ"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/Y76Tk5g/testing.png"></a>

HTML Validation

* both Errors - The metadata error was quickly rectified by amending the meta as below. Using the work description as an element of meta name. 

 <meta name="keywords" content="Mother and baby, toddler, Westport, mayo, west of ireland, connocht">
  <meta name="description" content="Mother and baby group, Westport, Mayo, Ireland">
 
<a href="https://ibb.co/s1RshM3"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/M1SPb3N/w3c-validator-HTML.png"></a>

HTML Validation

* Each of these error were easily amended by removing the extra spaces in the video link code and deleting the extra tabs.

<a href="https://ibb.co/swKx36S"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/3Np6hMX/pre-booking-HTML-from-testing-3.png"></a>

HTML Validation

* The above errors occured in the Pre-Booking page. The issues were rectified by ensuring both the label and the for element matched.

<a href="https://ibb.co/YQqsk5s"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/GpbS2ZS/pre-booking-HTML-from.png" ></a>

* The first error above was amended by removing the required element of the dropdown code. This information is not necessary to participate in the class.

* The second error was amended by adding an alt description to the image.

### CSS Validation

The following errors showed while testing my CSS code.

<a href="https://ibb.co/yF1P4bT"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/b5Zmb8h/CSS-validation.png"></a>

CSS Validation

* This was rectifited by removing the word device from the media query.

<a href="https://ibb.co/HhGCfQY"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/1zRMtxK/Div-tool-issue.png"></a>

CSS Validation

While no problems were indicated in the CSS file in GitPod, it did show up in validation. To fix this error, in the font-family declaration, I changed all the double quote around the font family to single quotes and the error cleared.


* Problem 1 - Main hero element.
I tested my idea of using a video for my hero element by creating a mock-up in Gitpod. As it was one of the main focuses of the landing page I wanted it to not distract from the other important elements on the page. 
I also:

    *Asked for advice and guidance from my mentor.
    *Posted on a Slack to get feedback from a broader user base.

* Problem 2 - Large images
As there are quite a few images, I soon realised that it would be more prudent to store them in the cloud and cropping and condense both the photos and video. This helped with the speed of the website and corpping the images helped with the quality for the user.

Soon I Devtool was showing the following warning:

<a href="https://ibb.co/HhGCfQY"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/1zRMtxK/Div-tool-issue.png"></a>

Devtool warning

The warning was due to the face that I had used up me free quota with Cloudinary.com. To rectify this I added new images to imgBB.

* Problem 3 - I struggled quite a bit with adding a Hamburger. As a new programmer i didnt realise at first that i was trying us add code that required JavaScript. In the end i found code on <a href="https://alvarotrigo.com/blog/hamburger-menu-css/" target="_blank">Alvarotrigo.com</a> but when added to my website i didnt like how it covered the hero image and decided it wasnt required.

* Problem 4 - I also struggled with the media queries and spent a lot of time on them. In high insight, I would trust the breakpoint method instead of adding screen maximum and minums and do more research into making my future website more responsive.

* Problem 5 - The links to google maps still keep showing an error.

<a href="https://ibb.co/HhGCfQY"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/1zRMtxK/Div-tool-issue.png"></a>

Devtool

While investigating it seems that the issue is on my system due to an add blocker.
