                In 1546 Grainne, who was 15 years old, married Donal O'Flaherty, son of the Clan O’Flaherty chieftain in Connemara and ally of the O’Malley. They lived at Bunowen castle on the coast near Ballyconneely, Co. Galway. In his company she learned and polished the art of boarding ships. She bore him three children: Owen (Eoghan), Margaret (Méadhbh) and Murrough (Murchadh). When her husband was killed fighting ashore, Granuaile, aged 23, took over his castle and fighting ships. Then she returned to Mayo with many followers.

Later in 1566 she married politically again, this time to Richard Iron Dick of the Burke or Lower MacWilliam family, another land fighter. According to tradition the couple married under Early Irish Law 'for one year certain’. With this marriage Granuaile gained control of Rockfleet Castle near Newport. She divorced him after one year calling out a window to Iron Dick: "Richard Burke, I dismiss you”, but in English documents they remained married.

They had one son Tiobóid na Long, "Toby of the Ships”, born around 1567.

She was able to manage to keep his castle and remained ally of Iron Dick.
