                    In 1580, after 15 years of battles and negotiations, Iron Dick Burke, Granuaile’s husband, was granted a knighthood by the English governor of Connacht, Sir Nicholas Malby. He was also given the highest title in Connacht, the McWilliam title. When the two men died, the new governor, Sir Richard Bingham, and his men persecuted Granuaile and her followers again. She made a historic journey sailing up the Thames wishing an audience with Queen Elisabeth I.

                    It is said, when they met at Greenwich Palace, Granuaile refused to bow before Queen Elizabeth because she was herself a Queen, and not a subject of the Queen of England. The two women spoke in Latin and came to an agreement. Queen Elisabeth I released her sons Tibbot Burke and Murrough O'Flaherty, and her half-brother, Dónal na Píopa, while Granuaile put an end to piracy against England.

                    Despite her life full of adventures Granuaile lived to an old age. She died in 1603 at Rockfleet Castle and was buried in the Cistercian Abbey on Clare Island. After her death, she became an Irish folk hero of almost legendary status.
